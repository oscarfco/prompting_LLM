CS 330 Code

To run our Experiments:
  1. Run all cells of one of the AMA_manifest notebooks
  2. Once that is done you can run one of the AMA_tasks notebooks. 

Prompt chains used are located in new_tasks/WSC_final.py and code that interfaces with the model is in new_tasks/decomposition.py

Our Error analysis was run Text Error Analysis.ipynb
